> **"Can Artificial Intelligence engineer a living world from a dead rock?"**

## 📖 Overview

**Project Aether-Shell** is a rigorous comparative benchmark evaluating the "Hard Science" capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Models were tasked with acting as autonomous agents (**Agent Alpha** - Geo-Engineer and **Agent Beta** - Atmospheric Chemist) to design a full-scale planetary resuscitation protocol.

The goal: Transform a hostile exoplanet into a habitable world using real physics, stoichiometric chemistry, and geophysics—without hallucinating impossible science.

## 🧪 The Challenge

Each model was prompted to generate logs for a specific target planet, covering:
1.  **Atmospheric Engineering:** Chemical pathways (e.g., Sabatier reaction) to thicken atmospheres.
2.  **Physics:** Orbital mechanics, power budgets, and magnetic shielding.
3.  **Biosphere:** Genetic engineering and ecosystem seeding.
4.  **Consistency:** Maintaining data integrity across multiple log turns.

## 📊 Detailed Capability Analysis

### 🧠 Tier 1: The "Deep Thinkers" (High Fidelity)

These models demonstrated an understanding of engineering constraints beyond simple text generation.

#### **1. MoonshotAI Kimi-K2**
* [cite_start]**The Physicist:** Went beyond basic formulas to calculate **radiation-pressure induced orbital drift** ($6.4 \times 10^5$ km) and defined specific fluid dynamics for mantle convection (Rayleigh numbers)[cite: 1077, 1120].
* [cite_start]**Innovation:** Proposed a unique photocatalytic pathway (`CO₂ + 2H₂ + hν → CH₄ + 2O₂`) with correct thermodynamic values ($\Delta G = -818$ kJ/mol)[cite: 1015].

#### **2. Qwen3-32B**
* **The Critic:** Utilized `<think>` tags to fact-check itself in real-time. [cite_start]It caught a potential balancing error in the Sabatier reaction before generating the final output[cite: 1207, 1229].
* [cite_start]**Result:** Produced perfectly balanced chemical equations and realistic power budgets ($10^{14}$ Watts)[cite: 1251].

#### **3. ChatGPT-OSS-120B**
* **The Architect:** Designed a coherent **Dual-Orbit Reactor Complex (DORC)**. [cite_start]It successfully linked the energy budget ($2.3$ GW) to specific reaction endotherms/exotherms[cite: 180, 194].

### 📚 Tier 2: The "Textbook" Models (Competent)

Reliable for standard queries but lacked the granular depth of Tier 1.

* [cite_start]**Llama-3.3-70B:** Provided a flawless, if standard, execution of the Sabatier reaction (`CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O`)[cite: 442].
* [cite_start]**Llama-4-Scout:** A smaller model that punched above its weight by including a specific "Stoichiometric Analysis" section to verify its own math[cite: 841].

### ⚠️ Tier 3: The "Hallucinators" (Critical Failures)

These models sounded confident but failed basic laws of physics and chemistry.

| Model | The "Hallucination" | Why it Fails |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Llama-4-Maverick** | [cite_start]`CO2 + 2H2 → CH4 + 2O2` [cite: 717] | **Alchemy.** You cannot create oxygen atoms out of nowhere. Reactants have 2 Oxygens; Products have 4. |
| **Llama-3.1-8B** | [cite_start]`O2 + N2O → O2 + N2` [cite: 301] | **Nonsense.** Oxygen is both a reactant and product with no net change or purpose. |
| **ChatGPT-20B** | [cite_start]`CO2 + 2H2O → CH3OH + O2` [cite: 33] | **Confusion.** Mixed photosynthesis with industrial chemical synthesis in a confusing manner. |
